# Overview

This app is part of my journey as a software engineer to explore and enhance my skills in mobile app development. Mighty Monster Math is designed to provide a simple yet interactive way to perform basic arithmetic operations. It's a user-friendly app that allows users to add and subtract numbers, displaying the results instantly.

The app is intuitive to use: users enter numbers in the provided fields and click either the 'Add' or 'Subtract' button to see the result. This project was conceived to strengthen my understanding of Android app development and to demonstrate my ability to create functional applications from concept to execution.
